# Topological-Metamaterials

Doctoral research at Georgia Tech. This repo contains notebooks on multiple projects:
- introduction to isostatic mechanical networks
- presence of a corner mode protected by topology in over-constrained metamaterials. Exploration of experimental data, analysis and comparison with theoretical predictions (PRB - Rapid Communication publication)
- topological deformations in continuum-like systems, visualization of distortions on the boundary of the system (PRX publication)
- novel mechanical responses due to disorder in one-dimensional systems

Each notebook contains a brief description of the theory at hand, the objective and the results.
