# Topological-Metamaterials

Doctoral research at Georgia Tech. This repo contains notebooks on multiple projects:
- introduction to isostatic mechanical networks
- presence of a corner mode protected by topology in over-constrained metamaterials (PRB - Rapid Communication publication)
- topological deformation in continuum-like systems (PRX publication)
- novel mechanical response due to disorder in one-dimensional systems

Each notebook contains a brief description of the theory at hand, the objective and the results.
